# Portable_BaKoMa.TeX
Due to the author, the BaKoMa TeX software has not been updated for many years. Even if you can download this software, you cannot try it at the moment. How can potential users try the software and make it last? 
It is currently possible to build a portable BaKoMa TeX using VMware ThinApp.
